# Make function to do a deterministic QMRA based on point-value inputs
```{r deterministic QMRA}

### Make function to calculate QMRA endpoints based on point-value inputs that were stochastic in our overall QMRA model
# Inputs:
#   rawpathconc = the pathogen concentration in the raw water, in organisms/L
#   DWvol = the volume of water consumed in each refill (21 refills per 7-day backpacking trip), in L
#   LRV = the treatment device LRV with respect to each pathogen, unitless
#   Pillinf = the probability of illness given infection with a pathogen, unitless
#   microbe: either "campy" or "giardia"

# Outputs:
#   not sure of format yet

# Process variables (were point-value in our overall QMRA model):
#   Dose-response relationship: For campylobacter, Pinf follows an approximate Beta-Poisson model with alpha = 0.144 and N50 = 890, per Medema (1996). For giardia, Pinf follows an exponential model with r = 0.0199, per Rose (1991)
#   DALY weight (DALY_weight): DALYS per illness, for campylobacter is 4.6E-3, and for giardia is 1.7E-3, per USEPA (2010)
#   Susceptible fraction (S): Susceptible fraction of the population, 100% for both campylobacter and giradia

FUN_detQMRA = function(rawpathconc, DWvol, LRV, Pillinf, microbe){
    
    ### Endpoint 1: overall trip exposure
    # Calculate the exposure per refill
    survival_frac = 10^(-1*LRV)     # Units are a % of the number of pathogens in the raw water (unitless)
    DW_conc_refill = rawpathconc * survival_frac * DWvol     # The number of pathogens in each refill (units of # pathogens)
    
    # Calculate the exposure over the 7-day trip (21 refills) --> First endpoint
    exposure_trip = DW_conc_refill * 7    # Units of # pathogens/7-day trip
